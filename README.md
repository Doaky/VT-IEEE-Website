# VT-IEEE-2018-Website
Website for Virginia Tech IEEE Chapter
Remade in 2018.

## Accessing Files
After making changes, the best way to add/remove/update files on [ieee.vt.edu](https://www.ieee.vt.edu/ "IEEE at VT Home") is to use Cyberduck.
I found [this guide](https://vt4help.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=bff451880fdfa900d3254b9ce1050e6f) to be very helpful. Feel free to email me if you have any other questions.

## Testing Locally
When making the website, I used [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html "XAMPP Download") to run the website locally.

Setup:
1. Download, install, and open XAMPP
2. Click "Start" for Apache in the Control Panel
3. Navigate to C:/xampp/htdocs/ and clone this repo
4. Open config.php and change the BASE_URL to dev
5. Open [localhost/VT-IEEE-Website/](http://localhost/VT-IEEE-Website/) in a webbrowser

The website will get updated with local changes on page refresh.
